<h1> Outline for Project 2 </h1>



<h3>
Overall: I want to create a site to display interactively a very loose story concept in my head.
It's a cyberpunk body horror story. My hope is to create an interactive site that will make the viewer
uncomfortable while telling this loose story. I'll try not to go overboard with it so here are 2 ideas: </h3>
<br> <br>

<p>
1.  I want a main screen with a movable images on click and drag.

<br> <br>
2. I also want to use the camera, to show the viewer with artwork overlays, and maybe make it "foggy" like a mirror.

<br> <br>
Links/How I will use them:
<br> <br>

<a href="https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet"> Camera/Motion Tracking for the "mirror" (that was used in ART101) </a>
<br> <br>

<a href= "https://www.createjs.com/demos/easeljs/alphamaskreveal">Foggy Mirror Effect, would love to somehow use this on the video element?</a>

<script>
function enter() {
  alert("Are You Sure You Want to Continue?");
}

<button type="button" onClick="enter()"> <a href= "./easel.html"> Click to See my Suffering </button>
