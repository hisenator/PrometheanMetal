<h1> Outline for Project 2 </h1>



<h3>
Overall: I want to create a site to display interactively a very loose story concept in my head.
It's a cyberpunk body horror story. My hope is to create an interactive site that will make the viewer
uncomfortable while telling this loose story. I'll try not to go overboard with it so here are 2 ideas: </h3>
<br> <br>

<p>
1.  I want a main screen with a movable images on click and drag, as well as a section where
I want it to incorporate "fleshy" elements that you can dig through. (this is technically two already but
maybe U can collide the two into one)

<br> <br>
2. I also want to use the camera, to show the viewer with artwork overlays, and maybe make it "foggy" like a mirror.

<br> <br>
Links/How I will use them:
<br> <br>

<a href="https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet"> Camera/Motion Tracking for the "mirror" (that was used in ART101) </a>
<br> <br>

<a href= "https://www.createjs.com/demos/easeljs/alphamaskreveal">Foggy Mirror Effect</a>
<br> <br>

<a href= "https://www.createjs.com/demos/easeljs/draganddrop"> For the movable images/objects</a>
<br> <br>

<a href= "http://paperjs.org/examples/voronoi/"> I'll admit- this is why I want to do the "fleshy" effect. Might drop it</a>
